### Summary
A shiny app that outlines my study on life satisfaction ratings across countries. How do various social, economic, and political factors influence how people rate their life satisfaction? This app tries to take a glimpse into that. 

This app was made as a final project for a Data Science Class I took back in 2021. Making the Shiny app was a fun experience and I caught a tiny glimpse into how data, front-end, and back-end code synchronize to make an app. Thanks for checking it out!
